    <p>
     Rome, the city that was the birth place of not only the <strong>Glorious</strong> Roman empire but also western civilization itself.
    </p> 

    <h2>Brief History </h2>



    <p>Rome was founded in the year 753 BC by refugees and people looking to escape their past and still survives to this day, 2773 years later. It would quickly become the dominant power in the region and become the captital of an empire that would hold most of western Europe and part of the middle east and north Africa. Even before the fall of the western Roman empire in 476 the city lost most of its power, but still hold a little bit by being the home of the Catholic Church. </p>
